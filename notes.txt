IP
- required by ST0 and ST2
  - ST0 always increments unless stalled
  - ST2 can fire LD without stalling
- EN = !_stall
- LD = ST2

RR
- Controlled by ST1 for return
  - if you want more depth save RR somewhere
  - Need JSR, RET, STR instructions

example programs with output peripheral at 0x10
Hello World
str db "Hello, World!", 0x00

main:
	LDX str
loop:
	LDA [x]
	CMP 0x00
	JE end
	STA [0x10]	; out
	INX
	JMP loop
end:

Fibonacci
A	n
0x00	n-2
0x01	n-1

main:
	LDA 0x01
	LDX 0x00
	STA [0x00]	; init n-2
loop:
	STX [0x01]	; move n-1 to n-2
	STA [0x01]	; move n to n-1
	ADD A, [0x00]	; add n-2
	LDX [0x00]	; did we overflow, also setup x
	CMP X
	JL  end
